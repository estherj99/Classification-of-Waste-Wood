In the future, the contribution of waste wood to the European wood demand is expected to increase. Waste wood can be divided into one of three categories: virgin wood, treated wood, and disposal wood. Virgin wood and treated wood can be used for energy applications and panel board production, whereas impregnated and painted wood must be disposed. Thus, a method to classify waste wood to determine the best decision for reuse is advantageous.

117 waste wood samples have been collected in Denmark and Italy. These were converted into wood chips and then been measured by NIR spectroscopy (Foss DS2500) in the spectral range of 1100 to 2498 nm (700 variables) in three replicates and with 32 scans. Large variability is expected for samples due to the heterogeneity expected for wood chips caused by surface treatments.

The aim of this final project is to build a classification model for sorting of waste wood material into one of three categories: virgin wood, treated wood, and disposal wood.
